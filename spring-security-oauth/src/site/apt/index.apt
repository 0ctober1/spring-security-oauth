Welcome

  Welcome to OAuth for Spring Security!

  As you can probably deduce from its name, the purpose of this project is to provide an {{{http://oauth.net}OAuth}}
  implementation for {{{http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/}Spring Security}}.  Support is provided
  for the implementation of OAuth providers and OAuth consumers. There is also support for {{{./twolegged.html}two-legged OAuth}}
  (a.k.a. "Signed Fetch") and for {{{http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2}OAuth 2.0}}, although 
  there are {{{https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SECOAUTH/component/10951}still some pieces that need to be done}}.

  Applying security to an application is not for the faint of heart, and OAuth is no exception. Before you get started,
  you're going to want to make sure you understand OAuth and the problem it's designed to address. There is good
  documentation at {{{http://oauth.net}the OAuth site}} and {{{http://oauth.net/documentation/getting-started}a good
  illustration of how OAuth is applied}}. You will also want to make sure you understand how {{{http://springframework.org/}Spring}}
  and {{{http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/}Spring Security}} work.

  With that, you're ready to get started.  You'll want to see {{{./tutorial.html}OAuth for Spring Security in action}}
  and read a more detailed explanation in the {{{./userguide.html}user guide}}.

  If you run into problems or have other questions, use the {{{http://forum.springsource.org/forumdisplay.php?f=79}forum}}.  Keep in mind that
  {{{http://webcohesion.com/}commercial support}} is also available.
